\section{Set Theory [4 points]}
Let $A$ be the set $\{x, y, z\}$ and $B$ be the set $\{a, b, x\}$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item Is $A$ a subset of $B$ and why?
\textcolor{blue}{
\\\textbf{No}, A is not a subset of B because B does not contain all elements of A. 
Definition of subset: Set B contains all elements of set A and more. \\For example in below, $A$ is a subset of $B$, but if we added a number that isn't 4 to A, it wouldn't be a subset of B.
$$A=\{1,2\},B=\{1,2,4\}$$
}
\item What is $A\cap (B \setminus A)$?
\textcolor{blue}{
\\Set Difference: All elements only in left hand set and not in right hand set.
\\Starting with 
$$B \setminus A \rightarrow \{ a,b\}=C$$
Set union: Combine elements in both sets
$$
A \cap C= \boxed{\{x,y,z,a,b \}}
$$
}

\item What is $A \times B$? %todo should confirm this is right since easy to fk up
\textcolor{blue}{
$$
\{x, y, z\} \times \{a, b, x\}\rightarrow 
\{ 
\{x,a \},
\{x,b \},
\{x,x \},
\{y,a \},
\{y,b \},
\{y,x \},
\{z,a \},
\{z,b \},
\{z,x \}
\}
$$
}

\item What is the powerset of $B$?
\textcolor{blue}{
Where $B=\{a, b, x\}$, powerset provides $2^n$ subsets (where n is number of elements), and is all subsets (including empty and the set itself).
\begin{gather*}
\mathcal{P} (B)\rightarrow \\ \{
\{\epsilon \},%todo is this how he denotes empty sets?
\{a, b, x\},
\{a \},
\{b \},
\{x \},
\{a,b \},
\{b,x \},
\{a,x \}
\}
\end{gather*}
}
\end{enumerate}
